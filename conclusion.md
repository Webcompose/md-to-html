# Conclusion

The topic of proliferation is complex and providing an in-depth analysis is a daunting exercise that goes against common sense for the average person and beyond the scope of our target reader. Anybody with the knowledge to understand such a breakdown of information would be educating themselves to be potential practitioners of making bombs. So asking the question â€œare bombs possible?" is tempting when the myth is so often repeated by the antinuclear groups as being feasible. The fact is that it is highly improbable as outlined in each of the five challenges mentioned above. The probability of success in eliminating all the challenges is compounded mathematically at each level. So put your mind to rest because after all we have the more immediate threat of things like car crashes, and coal ash ponds sliding into rivers, and toxic chemical plants leaking into rivers and exploding oil trains.
